- The language was introduced in 1995 and used to create programs in Netscape (Netscape was a browser similar to Google Chrome and Internet Explorer).

- All-purpose language but mainly used for building web applications

- Not to be confused with Java.  JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java except that they're both programming languages.
