  
Setting up a Node app with Express:

1) npm init

	- Creates a file called package.json which makes it easier to work with other devs
	  and keep track of dependencies

2) Answer the questions

	- At minimum, needs a name and version
	- Name must be all lower case, can be separated by dashes or underscores
	- Change entry point to server.js

3) npm install --save express

	- Express is THE standard server framework for Node.js
	- --save installs the framework locally as a dependency of the application

4) touch server.js

5) Set up server with a get request that responds with 'Hello, universe!'.
