This file contains examples of homeworks that can be assigned. 
Teachers don't have to stick to these exact assignments but do 
make sure assignments are relevant to whatever was covered 
that day.

a link to their gist on GitHub. Once they learn how to use
Git, they should then create repositories in GitHub - homework
submissions should be a link to their GitHub repo.
