## Curriculum Overview

The curriculum is split into two parts. The first 16 days concentrate on frontend and the second half on the backend. The number of days spent on a given topic are flexible as this is largely dependent on the cohort's skill level and aptitude for coding. Therefore, a minimum and maximum number of days for subjects is provided
