# Skillspire Full-Stack JavaScript Curriculum

## Introduction

This curriculum should be followed by all Skillspire instructors teaching the 32-day Full-Stack JavaScript course. Some parts of this curriculum will remain flexible and allow the instructor to use his or her best judgement - such parts will be specified within the curriculum.  

### Instructor responsibilities

Beyond teaching the curriculum, your responsibilites are as follows:

* Remain current on industry standards and best practices. This includes knowledge of popular frameworks.
* Use Canvas to assign homework.
* Use Canvas to grade homework (If you don't have time to grade assignments, this must be approved by Yasmin prior to the course starting. In some situations, a TA may be able to handle the grading for you.)
* Use Canvas to take student attendance.
* Use Slack to communicate with students and answer questions outside class
	* If you're sick or class is cancelled due to a holiday, inform students a day 	before


### Canvas
* Each instructor will need to create an account at canvas.instructure.com
* At the beginning of each cohort, do the following:
	* Create the course in Canvas
	* Add your students to the course
	* Add your TA if you have one
	* Add Yasmin and Sarah Khalidi as observers

### Who we cater to
Our students come from various backgrounds and ethnicities. A large percentage will be underprivileged working at least one full-time job. Still, they are expected to spend at least 10 hours studying each week outside of class. Most students will come into this class uncertain of whether they 

Student skill levels will vary. At minimum, students should be able to touch type and understand computer basics such as moving/locating files and knowing how to download/install software. 

## Student Requirements for Passing

* Cannot miss more than 3 total days of class (Instructor can make exceptions)
* Cannot miss more than 2 consecutive days
* Must receive minimum of 7/10 on each individual assignment
* Must have a completed application which they present at the end of the course. If a student cannot attend the last day, arrangements must be made with the instructor to present on a different day.
* Must pass final whiteboard interview

## Tools Students Need

* Slack for communication
* An account in canvas.instructure.com
* A GitHub account
* An IDE - instructor can choose but it should be a popular IDE.

## Structure of each day
* Take attendance at some point during each class and enter it in Canvas
* Once you introduce JS, every day should start with a "knowledge check" - an algorithm question to improve student skills. This should never be more than 30 minutes. 
	* Start of super simple. Remember that most of your students never wrote a line of code before.
	* As students advance, take question ideas from leetcode, codewars, and similar sites.
* Answer questions about the last assignment. If this takes more than 10 minutes, consider answering the question after class or over Slack
* Provide a brief overview of what you'll cover that day 
* Complete the lessons you have in mind for the day
* Leave a few minutes at the end of the class for questions
* At the end of each day post homework on Canvas and post your code on GitHub

## Curriculum Overview

The curriculum is split into two parts. The first 16 days concentrate on frontend and the second half on the backend. The number of days spent on a given topic are flexible as this is largely dependent on the cohort's skill level and aptitude for coding. Therefore, a minimum and maximum number of days for subjects is provided

### Frontend - Days 1-16

Topics 

* HTML (without CSS): 1-3 days
	* Don't spend more than 3 days but spend a minimum of 1 day covering basics
* CSS: 1-2 days
	* No more than 2 days concentrating on HTML/CSS before introducing JavaScript
* Frontend JavaScript: 8-13
* A frontend framework: 1-4 days
	* This curriculum specifies topics but popular frameworks change over time. Stay current with which frameworks are popular and select one that is suitable for your class. Current options include:

		* Angular 1
		* Angular 6
		* React
		* jQuery

### Backend - Days 17-27

* NodeJS: 2 days
* MongoDB: 1 day
* MEAN/MERN stack apps with RESTful API: Minimum 5 days
* Test Driven Development (optional)
	* Use chai/mocha or other popular test framework
* Task automation (optional)
	* Use grunt, gulp or other popular automation framework

### Final Project and Whiteboard Interview - Days 28 - 32

* In the last two weeks of the course, students should concentrate completing their final projects.
* The final day should begin with presentations. Once presentations are done, bring students one at a time into the room for their whiteboard interview. Expect each session to take 1 hour. Depending on the size of the class, this may have to be done over multiple days.


## Final Project
There are no set rules for the project. Students should come up with an application idea and work in groups of 2 or more.

### Next Steps

On the last day, be sure to talk to students about their next steps to get their first tech job. 

* Have a completed resume reviewed by an instructor
* Have a LinkedIn profile reviewed by an instructor
* Have at least 2 projects on GitHub that show off your skills

To get employed, students should be doing the following:

* Apply to 3 jobs every week
* Every day, alternate between improving algorith skills and working on a project
